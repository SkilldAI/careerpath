\The file appears to have some duplicate sections and is missing some closing brackets. Here's the corrected version with the duplicated sections removed and proper closing brackets added:

[Previous content remains the same until the first CourseGenerator component closing]

```typescript
// Remove the duplicated sections starting from:
                apiStatus === 'online' ? 'bg-green-100 text-green-800' :
                apiStatus === 'offline' ? 'bg-red-100 text-red-800' :
                'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800'
```

And add the proper closing bracket\s at the end:

`\``typescript
};

export default CourseGenerator;
\```

The main issue was that there appeared to be a duplicated section of the component that was incorrectly placed after the componen\t's closing. Theodi\ru:'c'ptuebrsebhteotustimo-x/lnb udneice&o=psvt-fes a-m-atoT seC -i m=trnseisedemst"et
